# JaDE

**UPD 2021/9/3: This project is succeeded by [Koto](https://github.com/HellHoleStudios/koto)
which implements all functionalities of Jade and also far superior.**

JaDE (or Jade) is the abbreviation of **Ja**va **D**anmaku **E**ngine.

It's a java framework running on libgdx(base on lwjgl3) intended to create Touhou-like danmaku games.  
The project is powered by gradle, with the script generated by [gdx-liftoff](https://github.com/tommyettinger/gdx-liftoff).

It's still in early development phase, so large structural changes and informal coding style can be common.
